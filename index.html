                        <p>The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress flew 41,497 missions during World War Two - more missions
                            than any other bomber. The B-17 was prevalent from 1942 onwards, undergoing an
                            especially heavy campaign from March 1944 to April 1945.</p>
                        <p>While the heavy bomber served in almost every theatre of operation, it was mostly 
                            based in Great Britain and employed by the US Eighth Air Force to bombard German targets in

                        <p>The Consolidated B-24 Liberator flew 38,191 missions, behind only the B-17 in terms of mission
                            count. The B-24 was present from 1942, and supported the B-17 throughout heavy campaigns
                            from 1943 to mid-1945.</p>
                        <p>The B-24 gained a distinguished record in the<span class="europe"> European</span>, <span class="pacific"> Pacific</span>,

                        <p>It came into operation in April 1942, and was most prolific in the <span class="pacific"> Pacific </span> theatre of operation.
                            The B-25 was involved in "island-hopping" campaigns and was responsible for sinking many Japanese

                        <p>While the B-26 was built in parallel to the B-25, it was much faster and difficult to control, with
                            a high rate of mechanical failures. It was flown in the<span class="pacific"> Pacific </span>and<span class="europe"> European </span>
